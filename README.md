## Installation

Install this project in your local development environment, follow the terminal commands:

```bash
git clone github.com/iharshka/VII-Ventures-Investment-Dashboard.git test-dashboard

cd test-dashboard
```

After this, Install a Live Server extension on your code editor, for example VS Code, follow the steps:

- Go to the _Extensions_ tab
- Search _Live Server_ and Install the first result Extension
- Now, a _Go Live_ button should be visible at the right bottom corner of VS Code Window. Clicking it will open the project on your local server on your browser.

*What if the *Go Live* button is not visible?*

- Right click on the index page and choose _Open with Live Server_
  This should open the project live in your local environment on your browser.

## Tech Stack

**Client Side**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- APIs Integrations
- built on top of Chart.js/Google Chart Library
- jQuery & DataTables
- Authorization using Ajax APIs
  **Server Side**
- Python
- Django
- MongoDB

## Deployment

Live at: https://investors.viiventures.co

- Frontend hosted on _Vercel_
- Backend hosted on _AWS EC2_

## Challenges

_What hiccups did I face during the project development (and how did I overcome them?)_

- Deployment to vercel due to the messed up directory structure (put index.html on root dir)
- Async calls handling bug due to which JS behaved unexpectedly (put the APIs data dependencies inside async function)
- Adding authorization to the APIs sending username and password with the APIs (sent them in header)
- Sharing tokens across JavaScript files on client side (used LocalStorage for now)
- Customising the libraries code to the desired outcomes (took help of Chart.js Documentations & ChatGPT)
- Adding hover tip to the pie charts (Added it with <div> and DOM manipulation)

## Lessons Learned

_What did I learn while building this project?_

- I learnt how to keep the directory structure deployment & development friendly
- I learnt how to display data in a graph, donut, bars, pie and tabular format, which can be built on some available libraries
- I learnt to integrate APIs into these components
- I learnt how to handle asynchronous calls
- I learnt to use Chrome Developer tool (console/network tabs) efficiently
- I learnt about how to add authorization to GET APIs
- I learnt how to understand the given codebase and contribute to it
- I learnt to use the best possible libraries & docs to use in the project for extra functionalities e.g. jQuery used for Animated World Map for showing investment made in the regions

## Future Updates

- Adding Password change functionality for users (with a dropdown in the profile section)
- **Major change** is adding user specific dashboard, for e.g. showing fund1spc only to specific set of users
