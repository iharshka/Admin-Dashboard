# VII Ventures Investment Dashboard

VII Ventures Investment Dashboard  is an Investment Dashboard for Financial Fund(s) management of a Venture Capital & individual Investment Portfolio management for Investors which keeps track of all of their investments using different metrics like MOIC, Portfolio Value, NAV, Profit/Loss, Region, Industry, Geography, Investment Cost, Current Value, Fund Percentage Distribution etc and display them in visually appealing format using JavaScript & jQuery libraries. 

The Dashboard has authentication which means it can only be accessed via a UserID and Password, further a user after using the Dashboard can Logout from the Dashboard which will redirect back to Login page and will clear the Login details.

## Installation

Install this project in your local development environment, follow the terminal commands:

```bash
git clone github.com/iharshka/VII-Ventures-Investment-Dashboard.git test-dashboard

cd test-dashboard
```

After this, Install a Live Server extension on your code editor, for example VS Code, follow the steps:

- Go to the _Extensions_ tab
- Search _Live Server_ and Install the first result Extension
- Now, a _Go Live_ button should be visible at the right bottom corner of VS Code Window. Clicking it will open the project on your local server on your browser.

*What if the *Go Live* button is not visible?*

- Right click on the index page and choose _Open with Live Server_
  This should open the project live in your local environment on your browser.

## Challenges

**Developer Backstory & Motivation**: While taking on this project I was very nervous thinking whether or not I would be able to do this or implement these functionalities because I never created these functionalities before than this project, neither I used these libraries, neither I integrated any APIs from the backend, neither did I work on Login/Logout functionalilty. I took the leap thinking I will have a good experience on JavaScript, APIs, Asycn calls etc so I accepted it without wasting much time thinking. After accepting it, in the first week, I spent my time looking for the tech stack to use where I came to know about **Chart.js**, **Google Charts** and its **Documentation**, that's when the project started to seem real, I implemented them in the website and customised them and after this came the second hump which was integrating the APIs which sailed off swiftly. After this, the third big hump was adding the Autherization to the APIs where **Stackoverflow** came into handy and past developer experiences helped a lot in crossing the sea.

_What other hiccups did I face during the project development (and how did I overcome them?)_

- Deployment to vercel due to the messed up directory structure (put index.html on root dir)
- Async calls handling bug due to which JS behaved unexpectedly (put the APIs data dependencies inside async function)
- Adding authorization to the APIs sending username and password with the APIs (sent them in header)
- Sharing tokens across JavaScript files on client side (used LocalStorage for now)
- Customising the libraries code to the desired outcomes (took help of Chart.js Documentations & ChatGPT)
- Adding hover tip to the pie charts (Added it with <div> and DOM manipulation)

As the result of these steps, I was able to do the version-1 of the website within one week which on several iterations on design has reached to this state.

## Lessons Learned

_What did I learn while building this project?_

- I learnt how to keep the directory structure deployment & development friendly
- I learnt how to display data in a graph, donut, bars, pie and tabular format, which can be built on some available libraries
- I learnt to integrate APIs into these components
- I learnt how to handle asynchronous calls
- I learnt to use Chrome Developer tool (console/network tabs) efficiently
- I learnt about how to add authorization to GET APIs
- I learnt how to understand the given codebase and contribute to it
- I learnt to use the best possible libraries & docs to use in the project for extra functionalities e.g. jQuery used for Animated World Map for showing investment made in the regions

Besides these learnings, this project has evolved my mindset as a Developer. We've to keep calm & seek information on the internet about the tech stack we're working on, there is something for every thing, from **official docs** from the developers of the tech stack to **Medium Blogs** to **StackOverflow** to **Open Source Repositories** of companies can help us clear the clutter and if all these still seems jarring then it's not bad to seek guidance from someone in our network or LinkedIn who might've worked on the same functionality and can help us get ahead. I am inspired to take more exciting & challenging projects and this time some bigger real life products where I can write code for thousands users. I am now confident that I've caught the Developer DNA & I can now work on any functionality, tech stack or technology that a project requires.

## Future Updates

- Adding Password change functionality for users (with a dropdown in the profile section) with a password update API and a user form.
- **Major change** is adding user specific dashboard, for e.g. showing fund1spc only to specific set of users this will be done through auth & accessibilty tokens.

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm Harsh, a problem solver, frontend developer & DevOps Eg, soon to be on backend and new techs (#Web3?, adaptive, u say). I want to work on a problem statement where I can cater to hundred thousands or million people or the one which keeps me stay up all night. Thank you for showing interest on this project. Neverming connecting with me on socials. See you soon.
